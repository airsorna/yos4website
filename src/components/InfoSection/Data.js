The major change here is that the web pages have all been integrated together to create a seamless experience when navigating. The user can scroll through all the web pages with the sidebar or use the navigation links in the header. I have made sure to keep the header present on all the pages, for that matter. This was also requested in my feedback for the last assignment. The website is also responsive, which was also added for this assignment. Please continue to the Style Guide.',
