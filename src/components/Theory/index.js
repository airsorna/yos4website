              <TheoryH2>Week 3</TheoryH2>
              <TheoryP>Last year, I really struggled with understanding JavaScript and APIs, partly because they weren’t explained properly on how to use them and when to use them, so I skipped the whole section on JavaScript and APIs. I have taken the initiative to try and learn as much as I need to know this year. As part of that, I’ve watched the revision videos, which I somewhat understand, but I believe doing it practically will propel me to understanding these concepts much quicker.</TheoryP>
              <TheoryP>For this week, I looked for inspiration for my internet art. Here's what I’ve found:<a href="https://www.arebyte.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwq-WgBhBMEiwAzKSH6FcTnsY8Gy8KbePGDC3A4QoRGzAIKvQtdGYetJFORkYbUpNksoYGDBoCJ50QAvD_BwELinks to an external site.Links to an external site." target="_blank">https://www.arebyte.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwq-WgBhBMEiwAzKSH6FcTnsY8Gy8KbePGDC3A4QoRGzAIKvQtdGYetJFORkYbUpNksoYGDBoCJ50QAvD_BwELinks to an external site.Links to an external site.</a> and <a href=" https://aoi.com/Links to an external site.Links to an external site." target="_blank"> https://aoi.com/Links to an external site.Links to an external site.</a></TheoryP>
              <TheoryP>The first website is arebyte; this looks great visually, as you can see the 3D model creatures moving around. I think this is really nice and well designed as a concept for a website. The second website is AOI, which also looks visually pleasing because of its moving art and overall color theme. Both are inspiration and concepts I'd love to deploy on my own website. My first impression of internet art was that I thought it was the same as data art, but then I came to the realization that internet art is art distributed through the internet, unlike data art, where you manipulate data into art. So far, I like what I see from the example made in class.</TheoryP>
              <TheoryP>The reading "The Work of Art in the Age of the Internet" by David Carrier makes reference to Walter Benjamin’s The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction and challenges the concept of art, especially authenticity, because, according to Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction of a work of art is essentially defined by multiple copies, so it shatters the aura by interrupting these founding traditions. However, Carrier pushes back on this by saying, "The original physical object is now merely the source, just as the author’s manuscript is the source of a novel, and the reproduction has become a genuine replacement for that object. And so owning the original is like owning the manuscript of a novel—a thing of value for specialists but not for the general public." (Carrier, 2020:4-5). Both are valid points, and I agree with both perspectives.</TheoryP>

              <TheoryP>Convention and Context by Steven Mailloux discusses how conventions are dependent on context. He makes a valid point when he says, "We can discuss conventions as ways of acting or as accomplishments of meaning, not only in literary and critical texts but also in discourses circulating in other cultural and social spheres." (Mailloux,1983:409). What I understand this to mean is that conventions are not a set of rules that must be followed at all times, but rather that conventions work hand in hand with context. In any given context, there are a set of conventions to be followed. How do I relate this to my understanding of UI and UX? Similar to conventions, UI and UX have a set of conventions one has to follow when designing a website, but again, not everything will apply as context is important. Maybe the website you plan to create doesn’t have an "about" page, for example. This is why context is important.</TheoryP>

              <TheoryH2>Reflection_______Posts.</TheoryH2>
              <TheoryP>IxD Process</TheoryP>
              <TheoryP>Goal Alignment: My goal is to create a personal website displaying all my work for the semester. It should contribute to my growth as a web developer and designer. It must showcase my creativity and understanding of what a website is and reflect my knowledge of coding with HTML and JavaScript. Moreover, it’s a website I want to show to some potential clients. So with that being said, I don’t have a specific target audience because, as I said, I want to show it to as many people as I want.</TheoryP>
              <TheoryP>Information Structure: Content Mapping: Content will be sorted in its appropriate category, e.g., if it's a blog post, it's under the blogs section. From then on, using knowledge of information hierarchy, the important elements or notes will be given higher preference as they are what the user engages with most of the time.</TheoryP>
              <TheoryP>CSS</TheoryP>
              <TheoryP>Picking up where we left off last week, we began working on our CSS coding for our website. This is where we start building the aesthetics and looks of our website. This is the glamourization part of the process, where things like color, font, layout, background, and image are stylized to give the website more life. The work I have done this week for the website was to implement a color scheme consisting of a white background paired with a toned-down green for the header and footer. The font I have chosen to use is Times New Roman for its slick and professional look.</TheoryP>

              <TheoryP>Convention and Context by Steven Mailloux discusses how conventions are dependent on context.

              <TheoryP>The Basic Principles of User Interface Design details important guidelines needed to be followed when making websites user friendly. These are rules that guide designers to make their UI better. Such as striving for clarity, as the main purpose of UI is interactivity between the user and website, this could be achieved by aiming for simplicity and being consistent. The list of things one can do to improve their UI design is endless, as this reading only offers the basics of user interface design principles but is a great place to start.</TheoryP>

              <TheoryH1>Net/Web Art Essay</TheoryH1>
              <TheoryH2>Introduction</TheoryH2>
              <TheoryP>
                    The introduction of the internet has seen the vast development of industries and the 
                    creation of new ones. The internet is no longer a search engine used for research by 
                    universities and government organizations but a central aspect of modern 
                    civilization. It goes without saying that the internet has impacted the way we 
                    consume information and products, especially in recent times when most companies, 
                    organizations, and people are taking their services online. The emergence of the 
                    internet along with the development of the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989 has
                    seen the growth and digitalization of entire industries, to which new terminologies 
                    and ways of consumption were introduced to mitigate these changes.
              </TheoryP>
              <TheoryP>
              One such industry that has changed over the years is the art industry. Traditionally 
speaking, we think of art as a physical manifestation of a production of some sort. 
Before music streaming was a thing, people used to purchase records, and before 
TV streaming, people would go watch plays at a theater. Although this is complex, it 
remains noteworthy that art, like many other things traditionally, is of physical 
production, whether that’s a painting, a picture, or music. We can acknowledge that 
fact. Fast-forwarding to the present day, we don’t define art by its physical presence 
in space and time, as Walter Benjamin wrote in his essay The Work of Art in the Age 
of Mechanical Reproduction. "Our fine arts were developed, and their types and uses 
were established, in times very different from the present, by men whose power of 
action upon things was insignificant in comparison with ours" (Benjamin, 1936). 
Hence, even purists cannot deny the production of art in this new medium.
              </TheoryP>
              <TheoryP>
              For this essay, I will be discussing net/web art that interests me in three main 
categories: conceptual, aesthetic, and technical. I will do a deep analysis of their 
designs and explain why I think they are pushing the frontier when it comes to digital 
and internet art. Finally, I will make reference to my website and how I feel I could 
implement some of these ideas into my everyday designs.
              </TheoryP>
              <TheoryH2>What is Net/Web Art?</TheoryH2>
              <TheoryP>
              Net art is artwork that uses the internet as its primary medium. It is artwork made on 
the internet for the internet and "includes a wide range of works created by artists 
using web browsers, developer codes, scripts, search engines, and various other 
online tools." (Artsy, 2023). Similar to how traditional artists use brushes and paints 
to create art for exhibitions. Speaking of exhibitions, net art is exhibited online. We 
could make the argument that the value of art is now determined by an everexpanding contemporary audience and is being lifted from the traditional warehouse 
of meaning and context, the museum. Art is increasingly designed with 
reproducibility in mind.
              </TheoryP>
              <TheoryP>The website I find to interesting, and I wish to mirror to some effect is <a href='https://snr4.com.mx/'>https://snr4.com.mx/</a> by SNR4 a creative developer from Mexico. His/her website titled SNR4 Portfolio is amazing and looks incredibly.</TheoryP>
              <TheoryH2>Conceptual</TheoryH2>
              <TheoryP>Beginning the analysis from a conceptual level, the website was intended to
showcase other websites and work he’s involved with. A title, description, and link 
are given for each website, and users can click on the link to visit the website. This is 
unlike anything I’ve seen. Usually, with portfolio pages, web designers tend to write 
long text accompanied by images describing the work they have done along with 
their accomplishments and experiences. This approach breaks that mold by having 
an active showcase, as if one is in a museum moving from painting to painting.</TheoryP>
<TheoryP>
It begins with a brief introduction of SNR4, and at the top right is his contact 
information. Right above SNR4 Portfolio is the number of pages on the web. A line 
animation going down communicates to the user to scroll down. Once the user 
begins to scroll, frames that act as canvas in a museum are suspended above the 
water, with 3D model astronauts viewing the image as if it were in a museum. The 
setup is like an exhibition, and the viewer moves from one art piece to another. I 
think this is an amazing concept that is far from conventional because "net art 
challenges preconceived notions of what the web is, how it works, and how users 
participate and experience life online." (Park, 2007:4). SNR4’s concept of having the 
user interact with his portfolio by scrolling and clicking is a brilliant design element 
that encourages the user to want to learn more about him and potentially inquire 
about his services.
</TheoryP>
<TheoryH2>Aesthetic</TheoryH2>
<TheoryP>
The SNR4 presentation is phenomenal. The setting or theme for the website is outer 
space, so he has astronauts, stars, and a reddish-orangish planet [I assume it's 
Mars] orbiting in the background. Each image is suspended in the air as the camera 
rotates around it. He uses the basic principles of user interaction design. Which are 
minimizing actions and steps per screen: users can only interact with one image at a 
time. Familiarity: users are repeating the same actions throughout. Reduce cognitive 
load and aim for simplicity: as he chose to have page numbers e.g. (3/11) and a line 
that loads as you keep scrolling. All these are important because "the Internet user is 
not merely a viewer or guest but is actively involved in and contributes to the net art 
experience—a unique situation not often present in other media and one that 
decentralizes and breaks down hierarchies of authorship" (Park, 2007:4), thereby 
implying the need for clearer use of signs and symbols. "Interface signs are the 
widgets, icons, words, menus, dialog boxes, wizards (assistant), and all interface 
elements that can convey messages. Interface signs convey the designer’s message 
to users and are also a medium to the interaction activity." (Leite, 2002). This is how 
SNR4 created a brilliant website, in my opinion. His "understanding that the words, 
language, and other signs that we use in our everyday and social contexts help to 
shape our reality." Kidd (2015: 20). Help create the experience he wants to convey to 
the user. This all plays a major role in look and feel of the website.

</TheoryP>
<TheoryP>
Continuing with the theme, SNR4 uses three main colors for this web page: dim blue 
for the background, light blue for the stars, and orange for the texts, which 
complement the reddish-orange planet. This looks simple and doesn’t offset any of 
the images or astronauts. Color is an important principle in UI and UX because 
"visual communication is a reality as soon as a word is typed, a color chosen, or a 
text displayed on the screen, and any visual expression, whether it is intentional or 
not, communicates something to the visitor of the site." (Thorlacius, 2007: 63). 
Therefore, "if we choose a vibrant, warm red color for the menu, we communicate 
something different than if we had chosen a calm, cool blue color." (Thorlacius, 2007: 
63). From a design perspective, everything on the SNR4 web page blends well 
together.
</TheoryP>
<TheoryH2>Technical</TheoryH2>
<TheoryP>
What I can deduce from SNR4’s website from a technical level is that he used a lot 
of JavaScript coding for the images, animations, navigation, and responsiveness of
the website. Such results are not hard-coded. It's clear, and it's something I want to 
do for my website too. I think it's impressive that as you scroll, the camera moves 
you to the next image, and once you stop, the camera rotates 360 degrees around 
the image. Furthermore, each image is a video clip playing a preview of one of his 
portfolio websites. This is what pulled me more into his website. It is an amazing way 
of displaying one’s work. When you look down, the water has ripples, indicating 
movement. Since the website feels like you are in constant motion, the ripples in the 
water play well into this effect and this showcases consistency throughout the whole 
experience. In my overall opinion, I think what SNR4 manages to do here is 
incredible. This is the kind of net art I aspire to make for my own website.
</TheoryP>
<TheoryH2>Conclusion</TheoryH2>
<TheoryP>
To conclude, SNR4’s website is incredible on so many levels. Looking at it as a 
concept for a portfolio showcasing all his work on an aesthetic level where colors, 
semiotics, and theme are made to relate to each other to form one website that is 
artistically creative and unique Finally, on a technical level, you have things like 
animation, camera movement, and video clips. When all these things come together, 
they form this amazing and well-designed piece of net art.
